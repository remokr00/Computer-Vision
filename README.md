The file 'SVPI2024_tp1.pdf' contains the project requirements. The file is in Portuguese. To ensure the program works, follow these steps:

1. Unzip the file 'images.zip' containing the images used for developing the project.
2. Leave the images in the folder immediately preceding the one containing the code.

Personal notes:

The code is not optimized. Developing this project in MATLAB was a completely new challenge for me as I had never used this programming language before.
